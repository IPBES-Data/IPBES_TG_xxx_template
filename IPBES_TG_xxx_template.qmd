## Workflow for TG Development (Here goes the TG)
**Version:** `r rmarkdown::metadata$version`

1. Update all metadata and the version number in the `README.md` YAML headers of this file
2. Add abstract to both documents
4. Link the github repo to Zenodo so that each release is automatically added to Zenodo
3. Write the TG in this document

## Workflow for TG Publication

Publication is done by creaating a new release, which is automatically pushed to zenodo as the repository
is linked to Zenodo.
There are a few manual steps which need to be done:

1. Update the version number in the `YAML headers of this file
2. render this document to HTML (at the moment, the only nsupported format - but we can think about offering pdf 
versions for the offline reading)
3. Check the renderd html document and make sure that all links are working and that the document is rendered correctly
4. Do a final check of the README.md to make sure that it is still up to date
5. Create a new release on github and upload the rendered html document as a release asset



**Do we need this section?**
Final version that has been approved by the Plenary and is ready for publication:

| Description | Version |
| --- | --- |
| File submitted for publication | `r rmarkdown::metadata$version` |
